# Tic-Tac-Toe
  Developed a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in the first year of college using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented a user-friendly interface with clear game rules and a visually appealing design. Utilized JavaScript to handle game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and tie detection.
